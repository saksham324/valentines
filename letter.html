        <h1>A Special Letter for You</h1>
        <p>Dear Nicole,</p>
        <p>Yesterday as I was looking for a photo of you for a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ZbEAX01zVhNT0lScC0qLg?si=9f54783b3b3c4c55&pt=665a90160fbd241f99ec77da9be7d92c"> Spotify playlist</a>  cover, I got emotional pictures of all the time we have spent together. From the first date with the charcuterie board to the time we went to Acadia and beyond, it has reminded me 
            how long we have been together and stayed together. This year we'll complete our second full year of being each others' best friends, confidants, caretakers, entertainers and lovers. I have wholeheartedly and throughly enjoyed watching myself take on 
            these different roles with you, and enjoyed you do the same even more. 

            This past year has been hard on me, on us, but I've seen you handle yourself and the circumstances around you with so much grace, and I have been so lucky to have you. I know I've made a lot of mistakes in the past year alone, but we've also worked through problems
            with even greater conviction and emerged out stronger. Your constant, almost unwavering belief in us inspires me daily and pushes me to become a better, stronger and more empathetic partner. I believe in you, and by believing in you I believe in us. I'm your biggest champion, your biggest cheerleader 
            and your biggest wellwisher. I see your potential when sometimes even you don't see it in yourself. You have so much to do and so much to achieve, and I could not be more excited to do it with you, together. 

            These letters we write to each other often coincide with big events in our lives, and this time I want to celebrate you. You, who is my love, you who stole my heart, and you who annoys me in soo many ways. But also you who handles all my drama and cribbing, you who continues 
            to push me and sees the potential in me. You, who I have fallen in love with, your eyes, your smile, your body and your beautiful mind. 

            I am so glad where we are right now. I try my best to be the best for you, I might fail at times but thank you for dealing with me and loving me so purely and so truly.

        <p>For my idea, I wanted to make a Memory Lane Chatbot Application. In this, we would upload a picture of each other or together, add a small note next to it and then over time as it accumulates our memories, we would be able to interact with it, chat with it and generate a timeline with it. 
            I hate how all our pictures are just sitting in a photo gallery with no cute, intuitive way to access them, and you know me how much I hate organizing things :P.
